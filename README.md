featuregauge
============

FeatureGauge allows users to gauge the interest level in new or existing features for a project by soliciting votes for them 
like Reddit. Customers can vote a feature up or down which will allow the project owners to gauge customer interest. 


The idea for this project came out of a hackathon I attended called DesertJS. It is implemented using the M.E.A.N stack 
(MongoDB, AngularJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS)
